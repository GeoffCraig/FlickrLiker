# FlickrLiker

## Why is this app a thing?
This application was the final application for an Android Programming Class.  It is not the greatest but it does the things that it does.

This app will NOT work until you replace the API_KEY in the MainActivity.java.  Go get a free Flickr key, it's easy to do and free.

## What does this thing do?

It uses Volley to get images from Flickr and you can click the like button to like the images.  Liked images are show in the Favorites tab.  The third tab provides the ability to put in three terms that are added to the API URI so that you can search for stuff you are interested in.

## Other things.

I probably forgot to put in whatever Flickr wants so you know the images are coming from Flickr but the title of the app is FlickrLiker so I hope that is enough.  Are there bugs?  I'm sure there are.  Why did you use techX or techY?  Well, those weren't covered in the course so I tried to stay within my lane.

Hope you enjoy!
